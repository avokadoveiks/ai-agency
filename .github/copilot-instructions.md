Development notes and repository guidelines

This file contains high-level guidance for contributors and maintainers.

Suggested actions:
- Clarify project requirements in the issues or a CONTRIBUTING.md file
- Keep the project structure tidy and document any important changes
- Use semantic HTML, modern CSS, and vanilla JavaScript for core features
- Add unit or integration tests where appropriate

If you want to add more detailed contribution instructions, create a
`CONTRIBUTING.md` at the repository root and link to it from this file.
